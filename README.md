# CS-255-Project-Two

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DrivePass project involved designing an online platform with the goal of helping students pass their driving tests. The client was DrivePass, a company looking to provide online and in-person driver educations services. They wanted to a system that would allow students to register for an account, schedule driving lessons, access online practices tests, and download lecture materials. The system also needed to be secure, scalable, and compatible across both desktop and mobile.

# What did you do particularly well?
One thing I did well was utilizing the user's requirements to ensure that the system's design aligns properly with what the clients desired during the interview. This involved understanding the different needs of various user roles (students, instructors, administrators, and It Officers) and ensuring each role had appropriate functionalities within the system. For example, students could schedule, modify, or cancel driving lessons, access online practice tests, and download educational materials, while administrators had role-based access to manage user accounts, track activities, and maintain the system's security. 
I also integrated a cloud infrastructure like what was mentioned during the interview for a scalable system that could handle a growing number of users without performance issues. The system's use of role-based access control and security measures like SSL encryption and two-factor authentication ensured that both functionality and security were addressed. Also the use of UML diagrams and structured design documents further helped in visualizing how different components of the system interact, ensuring clarity and alignment with the client's vision. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I only just learned about the different types of UML diagrams this semester. While I have written journals in the past, writing is not my strongest attribute, though I am committed to improving as I continue in my career. If I were to revise one part of my work, it would be the clarity of my written descriptions and the organization of my UML diagrams. In some sections, I used terms that were too vague. For example, in my original requirements document, I frequently used words like "modular" or "scalable," assuming others would understand their technical implications and benefits for DriverPass. For instance, I wrote, "The platform will be cloud-based to ensure scalability to handle a growing number of users." While this is technically accurate, these phrases may not resonate with a non-technical audience. A clearer explanation could be, "The system will use third-party cloud resources, such as AWS or Azure, which are designed to automatically adjust to handle increased user demands, ensuring reliability even as usage grows."
I also realize that my UML class diagrams included too much information, which made them difficult to read, especially in the document format. While I originally thought this would help developers see the entire system, it ended up overwhelming the diagrams. I would revise this by breaking them into smaller, more focused components to improve legibility and comprehension. Additionally, I would display the diagrams in a larger, more user-friendly format to make them easier to review.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Honestly, I just kept the interview notes with me throughout the entire design process. I read them multiple times, fact-checking every decision against what the client had communicated. I wrote a bullet point list of all the client's desires and requirments and categorized them. This allowed me to stay aligned with their vision and avoid misunderstandings. As for why it's important to consider the user's needs. It's essential that the final product aligns with the client's business goals. If a system is built without the user's specific requirements in mind, it may lead to confusions and a lack of clarity for the developers in where the system's final design is going. It could even lead to an outright failure of the production of the product itself. If DriverPass needed a packaging system, and the packaging system was the only means for DriverPass to make back the money to cover its costs on the cloud-based infrastructure. The feature could fall through the cracks or have a delay in development if I did a poor job of illustrating the need for such a system. Accurately reflecting the user's needs minimizes redundancy and a need for rework.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I would approach designing software by first thoroughly understanding the client's requirements and user needs, journalling all of these and listing them. I would then develop use case diagrams and activity diagrams to map out the system's functionality and describe them thoroughly in concise language. In the future, I plan to continue using UMl diagrams for visual clairty and focus more on interviews and feedback loops to ensure the design remains aligned with the client's ultimate goals.
